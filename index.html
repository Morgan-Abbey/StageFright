    Stage Fright is a five-piece indie rock band hailing from the bustling music scene of Portland, Oregon. Formed in
    2018, the band quickly became known for their raw, emotionally charged performances and lyrics that capture the
    vulnerability of modern life. True to their name, the members of Stage Fright infuse their music with themes of
    anxiety, self-discovery, and resilience, creating anthems that resonate with anyone who's ever felt a little out of
    place.
    Their sound blends melancholic melodies with explosive choruses, drawing inspiration from classic rock legends and
    modern alt-rock pioneers alike. The lineup consists of lead vocalist and lyricist Harper Lane, guitarist and
    co-songwriter Jake "Buzz" Calder, bassist and groove master Riley Novak, drummer Emily "Ember" Hayes, and
    multi-instrumentalist and synth wizard Alex Vega.
    Stage Fright's debut album, Behind the Curtain, released in 2020, put them on the map with its breakout single,
    "Glass Heart," a haunting track that quickly became a fan favorite. Their follow-up EP, Second Act, expanded their
    sonic range, incorporating electronic elements and cinematic soundscapes.

    The band has a reputation for their DIY ethos, managing everything from album artwork to merch design themselves.
    Despite their self-proclaimed introversion, Stage Fright thrives on connecting with audiences through music that
    feels deeply personal yet universally relatable.

    Offstage, the band members are as eclectic as their music, each with their quirks and creative pursuits that
    influence their sound. Whether it’s Harper’s love of poetry, Buzz’s vinyl collection, or Alex’s obsession with
    vintage synthesizers, their unique chemistry keeps their music fresh and authentic.

    With their third album currently in the works, Stage Fright is ready to prove that even the most reserved voices can
    leave a lasting impact. Their fans, affectionately known as "The Audience," wouldn’t have it any other way.
